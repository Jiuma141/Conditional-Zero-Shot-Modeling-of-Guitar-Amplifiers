# Conditional Zero-Shot Modeling of Guitar Amplifiers 🎸

This project explores **conditional zero-shot modeling of guitar amplifiers** using deep learning.
It aims to **replicate the sonic characteristics** of real guitar amplifiers while allowing **control via tone and knob embeddings**, enabling flexible tone cloning and parameter-conditioned audio generation.

## 🚀 Features

* **Zero-Shot Tone Cloning**
  Capture the timbre of unseen guitar amplifiers without retraining.

* **Conditional Control**
  Supports **knob-parameter conditioning** (e.g., gain, EQ) for realistic amplifier behavior.

* **Learned Tone Embedding**
  A contrastive-trained **tone encoder** maps reference audio into a compact embedding space for conditioning.

* **High-Fidelity Audio Modeling**
  Generator network trained with **multi-resolution STFT loss** and **spectral convergence loss** for perceptual quality.

## 🛠️ Methodology

* **Tone Encoder (E):**
  A SimCLR-inspired encoder projects audio into a 128-D tone embedding.
  Trained on AMP-SPACE dataset for supervised tone similarity.

* **Conditional Generator (G):**
  Implemented with **FiLM-GCN blocks**, modulated by both **tone embedding** and **knob parameters**.

* **Training Losses:**

  * Multi-Resolution STFT Loss
  * Spectral Convergence Loss
  * Complex Spectral Loss

## 📊 Dataset

* **AMP-SPACE Dataset**
  Contains dry/wet guitar signal pairs across diverse amplifiers and settings.
  Preprocessing includes:

  * Loudness matching
  * Peak normalization
  * Resampling
  * Knob parameter normalization
